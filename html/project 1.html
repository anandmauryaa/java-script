<h1>Profile</h1>
<p><font size="+2">A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading 
India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. 
In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies,
Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast. 
</font></p>

<h1>Grind through the ranks </h1>
<p><font  size="+2">He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in <font color="blue"><u>Sri Lanka</font></u>,
 come <font color="blue"><u>August 2008.</font></u> 
In the absence of the regular openers, Virat Kohli was given a chance to open
 the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his
 extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However,
 the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out
 of the team </p>
<p>The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks,
 clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that junior
 cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009
 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the
 bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, lacing
 a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a 
clinical victory. <font color="blue"><u>The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his
 man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7
 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh 
in the selectors' minds</font>.</u></p> </font>

<h1>A baptism by fire Down Under </h1>
<p><font  size="+2">The selectors and the captain persisted with him going into the 3rd Test,
 and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth wicket - an
 impressive 75 - where a visible change in technique was visible. He managed
 to stand tall, with a more open stance, and exhibited the back-foot shots in 
his repertoire during the course of the innings. The volatile Kohli managed 
to overshadow his impropriety in conduct with his performance in the final
 Test of the series. Notching up India's only century of a disastrous tour,
 Kohli was the shining light in amidst the chaos, as he stroked his way to a 
hundred in Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus
 under pressure in the searing heat and pressure of Australia.</p> 
<p>
While he grappled and clawed his way into the Test side, he went on a record
-breaking spree in ODIs: the Indian record for the fastest to multiples-of-thous
and runs in ODIs, culminating in the world record for the fastest to 9000 runs 
in ODIs.<font color="blue"><u> He was also the highest run-scorer for India in ODIs for three consecutive
 calendar years - 2010, 2011 and 2012 and won the ICC ODI cricketer 
of the year award in 2012.</font></u> </p></font>

<h1>Technical Shortcomings </h1>
<p><font  size="+2">However, his slightly unconventional bottom-hand technique
 results in some technical shortcomings and lack of versatility. Kohli has dealt 
with swing bowling well, which is late and difficult to pick, but still less abrupt
 than seam bowling, which is almost unnatural and catches you off-guard. 
He is, without a doubt,<font color="blue"><u> one of the most gifted cricketers who has also worked
 very hard on his game and fitness. </u></font>As a result, he picks the length early and
 has a swift and decisive backward or forward movement. However, he picks
 up the line early too, and as a result, reacts to it equally early. This is quite
 amazing in itself; however, on pitches lacking true bounce and aiding seam
 movement, it brings about his downfall. Virat tends to 'run his hands through
 the ball' beside him rather than punching it late under his line of vision
 (a virtue that his compatriot Ajinkya Rahane excels at). </font></p>


<h1>That break-through innings…</h1>
<p><font  size="+2">We remember the accolades, but where did it all begin? There's always the
 one innings that made the world sit up and take notice; the 86-ball knock 
which he started off as a brash boy, but ended as a man. Chasing an
 improbable target of 321 off 40 overs to stay alive in the tournament,
<font color="blue"><u> he laid 
into the Sri Lankan bowlers and carted his way to 133*</font></u>, getting India home
 with more than 2 overs to spare, practically pulling them out of the airport 
after M.S. Dhoni rather ignorantly remarked that India had already been 
eliminated from the tournament. </p>

<p>King Kohli had arrived. <font color="blue"><u>The king of the run-chase, and a plethora of ODI 
records in the modern age.</font></u></p></font>

<h1>IPL and T20 dominance </h1>
<p><font size="+2">He continued his emphatic run in the World T20, batting
 (and running) like a man possessed, thrashing boundaries with ridiculous
 ease. Despite an 89* in the semi-final against the West Indies (extending his
 inhuman run of form in the format), India's bowling panicked at a crucial stag
e. One had to feel sorry for him as he had to make do with the 'Player of the to
urnament' award for the second successive Twenty20 World Cup; a distinction
 he would've gladly exchanged for the elusive World T20 trophy. Kohli's thirst
 for runs showed no signs of slowing down as <font color="blue"><u>he looted a small matter of 973
 runs during the 2016 edition of the Indian Premier League, </u></font>the most (by far)
 by any batsman in the history of the tournament - as he led his Royal Challengers
 Bangalore (RCB) franchise to a runners-up finish. </font></p>
